Watermarker
===========

Watermarker is a Perl script that watermarks an image and saves the result as a JPEG file. The script **requires** the `Image::Magick` module.

*N.B.*: I have just started learning Perl and this is my first script that actually *does* something useful for me (and my work). Therefore, please refrain from laughing if the code makes you wonder why I even bothered committing it.
